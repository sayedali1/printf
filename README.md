# printf

### An ALX Software Engineering pair programming project to create a limited version of Linux's printf program.

* In this project, we demonstrated our team working skills, along with extensive research and curiosity.
* We used the man pages as a refrence on how our printf should work 
* This influenced the design of our code
* Project contains several files for different functions
* Functions are organized and called through a struct array 
* Each function corresponds to a different character 
* Characters are the specifiers of each function 
* Variadic functions are implemented to help contain any number of arguments
